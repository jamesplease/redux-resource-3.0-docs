usage.\n\nIntroduction\nThe introduction explains why this library exists, and also explores\nalternative solutions.\n\nResources\nThis section of the guides cover resource data, resource metadata, and resource lists.\n\nRequests\nRequests represent asynchronous updates to resources. Learn more about them here.\n\nOther Guides\nThese guides cover additional topics related to using React Request.\n\nRecipes\nRecipes are recommended patterns and best practices that you can use in your\napplication.\n\nEcosystem Extras\nRedux Resource provides officially maintained bits of code that make\nworking with the library even better.\n\nFAQ\nAnswers to frequently asked questions.\n\nAPI Reference\nDescribes the API of all of the exports of Redux Resource.\n\n\nQuick Start\nFollow this guide to get a taste of what it's like to work with Redux\nResource.\nFirst, we set up our store with a \"resource reducer,\" which is a reducer that\nmanages the state for one type of resource. In this guide, our reducer will\nhandle the data for our \"books\" resource.\nimport { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux';\nimport { resourceReducer } from 'redux-resource';\n\nconst reducer = combineReducers({\n  books: resourceReducer('books')\n});\n\nconst store = createStore(reducer);\n\nOnce we have a store, we can start dispatching actions to it. In this example,\nwe initiate a request to read a book with an ID of 24, then follow it up with an\naction representing success. There are two actions, because requests usually\noccur over a network, and therefore take time to complete.\nimport { actionTypes } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\n// This action represents beginning the request to read a book with ID of 24. This\n// could represent the start of an HTTP request, for instance.\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,\n  resourceType: 'books',\n  resources: [24]\n});\n\n// Later, when the request succeeds, we dispatch the success action.\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED,\n  resourceType: 'books',\n  // The `resources` list here is usually the response from an API call\n  resources: [{\n    id: 24,\n    title: 'My Name is Red',\n    releaseYear: 1998,\n    author: 'Orhan Pamuk'\n  }]\n});\n\nLater, in your view layer, you can access information about the status of\nthis request. When it succeeds, accessing the returned book is straightforward.\nimport { getStatus } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nconst state = store.getState();\n// The second argument to this method is a path into the state tree. This method\n// protects you from needing to check for undefined values.\nconst readStatus = getStatus(store, 'books.meta[24].readStatus');\n\nif (readStatus.pending) {\n  console.log('The request is in flight.');\n}\n\nelse if (readStatus.failed) {\n  console.log('The request failed.');\n}\n\nelse if (readStatus.succeeded) {\n  const book = state.books.resources[24];\n\n  console.log('The book was retrieved successfully, and here is the data:', book);\n}\n\nThis is just a small sample of what it's like working with Redux Resource.\nFor a real-life webapp example that uses many more CRUD operations, check out\nthe zero-boilerplate-redux webapp ⇗.\nThis example project uses React, although\nRedux Resource works well with any view layer.\nContributors\n(Emoji key)\n\n\n\n\nJames, please&#x1F4BB; &#x1F50C; &#x1F4D6; &#x1F914;\nStephen Rivas JR&#x1F4BB; &#x1F4D6; &#x1F914;\nIan Stewart&#x1F914;\nTim Branyen&#x1F914;\nJason Laster&#x1F914;\nmarlonpp&#x1F914;\nJavier Porrero&#x1F914;\n\n\n\n\nSmai Fullerton&#x1F4D6;\nvinodkl&#x1F914;\nEric Valadas&#x1F4D6;\nJeremy Fairbank&#x1F687;\nYihang Ho&#x1F4BB;\nBryce Reynolds&#x1F4A1;\nBen Creasy&#x1F4D6;\n\n\n\n\nThis project follows the all-contributors\nspecification.

Because\ncommunicating with remote servers requires sending messages over a network,\nreading and writing this state does not happen instantly. The requests take\ntime, and they may sometimes fail.\nThese network requests are often made as a result of a user's action within the\napplication. It's a developer's responsibility to provide feedback to the user\nabout these requests. When using Redux, this means writing reducers that change\nyour store's state tree based on the status of these requests. If your\napplication has many resources, you can run into problems when you write these\nreducers by hand.\nFor one, simply figuring out what information needs to be tracked can be\ndifficult to figure out. Request tracking is a complicated problem.\nWhen you do figure out something that works, it may be implemented slightly\ndifferently for different resources in your state tree. This inconsistency will\npropagate to your view layer. Code bases that are not consistent are more\ndifficult to maintain.\nAdditionally, tracking all of this data for every request requires writing a lot\nof reducer code. You may omit writing some of that code to save on time. This\ncontributes to inconsistency, and also gives you, the developer, less\ninformation to use when providing feedback to users.\nRedux Resource is intended to solve these problems. It provides a system of\norganizing information about request state in a consistent way. It also comes\nwith reducers that keep track of as much information as possible about every\nrequest made to remote servers, so that you don't have to.\nUse Redux Resource to have more time to build great interfaces, rather than\nwriting boilerplate Redux code.\n"},"docs/introduction/core-concepts.html":{"url":"docs/introduction/core-concepts.html","title":"Core Concepts","keywords":"","body":"Core Concepts\nRedux Resource has two concepts: \"Resources\" and \"Requests.\"\nResources\nA resource is an object of data that you interact with in your applications.\nTypically, applications will have resources of several different \"types.\" For\ninstance, if your web application manages a public library, then you might have\ntwo resource types: \"books\" and \"members.\"\nEach individual resource has a unique ID, which differentiates it from other resources of the\nsame type. Resources typically have other attributes, too. Here's an example book resource:\n{\n  id: '1312',\n  title: 'The Hobbit',\n  releaseYear: 1937,\n  author: 'J.R.R. Tolkien'\n}\n\nIn Redux Resource, each resource type will be kept in its own\nslice of\nyour store.\nThe slices contain not just the \"raw\" resource data, but also other information\nthat help you to manage and organize the data on the client.\nThere are five pieces within a resource slice:\n\nresourceType: The resource type (such as \"books\" or \"authors\")\nresources: The location of individual resource's primary attributes\nmeta: Additional information about individual resources. You can store information\nhere that isn't persisted to a remote server.\nlists: A way to store ordered arrays of resources.\nrequests: Information about the requests that are modifying this resource type (requests\nwill be covered in greater detail in the \"Requests\" section of this guide)\n\nAn empty resource slice looks like the following:\n// \"books\" resource slice\n{\n  resourceType: 'books',\n  resources: {},\n  meta: {},\n  lists: {},\n  requests: {}\n}\n\nResources\nIn the resources section of the slice, each key of the object is the resource's ID. This\nlooks like the following:\n// \"books\" resource type slice\n{\n  resourceType: 'books',\n  resources: {\n    24: {\n      // Attributes of book 24\n    },\n    100: {\n      // Attributes of book 100\n    }\n  },\n  meta: {},\n  lists: {},\n  requests: {}\n}\n\nThis structure makes it convenient to quickly access a resource's attributes if you\nknow its ID.\nResource Metadata\nTypically, client-side applications need to store additional information about\nresources, such as if the resource has been \"selected\" by a user, or maybe\ninformation about the resource that has been input into a form.\nResource metadata is for this purpose. It's any information that is not\npersisted to a remote server.\nIn Redux Resource, all metadata is stored on an object. This meta object,\nlike the resources object, has resource IDs as its keys, and has values that are\nmetadata. An example is:\n// \"books\" resource type slice\n{\n  resourceType: 'books',\n  resources: {},\n  meta: {\n    24: {\n      // Metadata for book 24\n    },\n    100: {\n      // Metadata for book 100\n    }\n  },\n  lists: {},\n  requests: {}\n}\n\nResource Lists\nOften, applications need to keep track of ordered groupings of resources. For instance,\nhas a user selected certain books on the interface? Or did you fetch a user's recent book\npurchases from a server, sorted by purchase date?\nIn Redux Resource, both of these situations can be handled using resource lists.\nLists in your store are an array of resource IDs. A resource's lists might look\nlike the following:\n{\n  resourceType: 'books',\n  resources: {},\n  meta: {},\n  lists: {\n    searchResults: [10, 233, 4, 50],\n    shoppingCart: [10, 409],\n  },\n  requests: {}\n}\n\nRedux Resource provides Redux actions for you to create, update, and delete lists.\nRequests\nThe last section of the resource slice is called requests. This is an object\nwhere each key is maps to a request object, described below.\nRequests\nRequest objects represent network requests, such as HTTP requests. Like resources,\nthey are stored in the store.\nTypically, requests are HTTP requests, but they can represent anything that is\nasynchronous. The primary characteristic of requests is that they do not occur instantly.\nThey take time to complete, and they don't always succeed.\nIn Redux Resource, this characteristic of requests is represented as one of four \"statuses\":\n\nIDLE: the request hasn't begun yet\nPENDING: the request has started, but has not yet finished\nFAILED: the request was unsuccessful\nSUCCEEDED: the request was successful\n\nIn addition to having a status, a request keeps track of the resources it operated upon.\nRequests in Redux Resource are associated with a resource type, which is the primary resource\ntype that is being affected by the request. Accordingly, the requests can be found within\nthat resource's slice, under the requests key.\nWithin requests, each key is a \"request key,\" which is a string used to identify that request.\nA request with the key \"readFavoriteBooks\" would be stored like the following:\n{\n  resourceType: 'books',\n  resources: {},\n  meta: {},\n  lists: {},\n  requests: {\n    readFavoriteBooks: {\n      requestKey: 'readFavoriteBooks',\n      status: 'SUCCEEDED',\n      // The resources that were affected by this crud action\n      ids: [24, 10, 50]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nConclusion\nWhen you use Redux Resource, information about every CRUD operation that you\nmake in your application is stored in your application's state tree.\nBy storing this information at such a granular level, Redux Resource provides\na robust foundation from which you can build truly great user experiences. And\nyou avoid writing a substantial amount of boilerplate code.\n"},"docs/introduction/similar-projects.html":{"url":"docs/introduction/similar-projects.html","title":"Similar Projects","keywords":"","body":"Similar Projects\nThis isn't the only library that aims to reduce boilerplate when it comes to\nmanaging resources.

For each resource type in your application, you should use\nthis function to create a reducer. A resource reducer will manage all of the state for its resource\ntype.\nCreating a resource reducer is the first step to getting started with Redux Resource. If your\napplication manages books, then you would create a reducer for the books resource like so:\nimport { resourceReducer } from 'redux-resource';\n\nconst booksReducer = resourceReducer('books');\n\nOnce you have your resource reducers, you need to combine them into a single reducer. Users of Redux\nfrequently use combineReducers\nfor this purpose. When you use combineReducers, your store is divided up into slices, where each\nreducer that you input manages its own section of the state. These sections are often called \"slices.\"\nThe rest of this documentation will frequently refer to \"resource slices,\" which are the slices of your\nstore that are managed by a resource reducer.\nThe following code snippet demonstrates how you might set this up:\nimport { combineReducers } from 'redux';\nimport { resourceReducer } from 'redux-resource';\n\nconst reducer = combineReducers({\n  books: resourceReducer('books'),\n  authors: resourceReducer('authors'),\n  people: resourceReducer('people'),\n});\n\nThe resourceReducer function takes a second option, which can be used to configure the resource reducer.\nRefer to the API documentation for resourceReducer to\nlearn more.\n\nNote: keep in mind that Redux Resource works with or without combineReducers.\n\n"},"docs/resources/resource-objects.html":{"url":"docs/resources/resource-objects.html","title":"Resource Objects","keywords":"","body":"Resource Objects\nEach resource slice has a property called resources. All of your resource data is stored\nhere.

But this guide\n  // will focus on the `resources` section of the slice.\n}\n\nThe resources object allows you to quickly access any resource given its ID. For instance,\nthe following code demonstrates accessing the data for the book with ID 102:\nconst state = store.getState();\n\nconst book = state.books.resources[102];\n\n\nNote: For more advanced retrieval of resources from the store, you can use the\n  getResources method.\n\nWhat is a Resource?\nResources are the individual pieces of data that come from your backend. For instance,\nif you're using a RESTful API, you might have an endpoint, GET /books/24, that returns\nyou the information for the book with the ID 24. That information is a single resource.\nThe only requirement of a resource is that it must have an id\nproperty. The following are some examples of valid resources:\n{\n  __typename: 'Person',\n  id: 23,\n  firstName: 'Bill',\n  lastName: 'Graham',\n  friendId: 250\n}\n\n{\n  id: '23',\n  attributes: {\n    firstName: 'Bill',\n    lastName: 'Graham'\n  },\n  relationships: {\n    friend: {\n      type: 'person',\n      id: 250\n    }  \n  }\n}\n\n{\n  id: '1586353b-7891-48ef-956a-07ea4d40e98f'\n}\n\nWe understand that not all backend services return data that have an ID attribute.\nFor such services, a transformation function will need to be written to change\nthat data into Redux Resource-compatible resources. We understand that this isn't\nideal, but we believe the benefits of Redux Resource outweigh this\ninconvenience.\nHere are some examples of common data formats that a backend may send over, and\nhow you can change them into Redux Resource compatible resources.\n// Backend returns:\n[\n 'en',\n 'fr',\n 'es'  \n]\n\n// Transform it like so:\n[\n  {\n    id: 'en'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 'fr'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 'es'\n  },\n]\n\n// Backend returns:\n{\n 'en': 'English',\n 'fr': 'French',\n 'es': 'Spanish'\n}\n\n// Transform it like so:\n[\n  {\n    id: 'en',\n    displayName: 'English'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 'fr',\n    displayName: 'French'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 'es',\n    displayName: 'Spanish'\n  },\n]\n\n// Backend returns:\n[\n {\n   bookId: 23,\n   title: 'The Brilliance of the Moon'\n },\n {\n   bookId: 120,\n   title: 'The Good Thief'\n },\n {\n   bookId: 255,\n   title: 'My Name is Red'\n }\n]\n\n// Transform it like so:\n[\n  {\n    id: 23,\n    title: 'The Brilliance of the Moon'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 120,\n    title: 'The Good Thief'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 255,\n    title: 'My Name is Red'\n  }\n]\n\nModifying Resources\nThere are two ways to modify resources: synchronously and asynchronously.

You can put\nanything that you would like here. Typically, the information that you store within meta\nare the things that are useful for the client-side application, but that don't need to be\nsent to the server.\nResource metadata is intended to solve the problem some developers encounter when they pollute\nserver-side data with client-side data. Mixing the two can get messy. Use metadata to keep things\norganized.\nThe following example slice has some metadata, selected, associated with two resources.

Here are some examples:\n\nmostRecent\nsearchResults\nfavorites\nselected\n\nYou could include the resource type in the name, too (i.e. \"selectedBooks\").\nSometimes, you may need to use a dynamic list name. A dynamic list name is a string that has\na variable component to it, such as:\n`authorsBooks:${authorId}`\n\nIt is okay to use dynamic names, but keep in mind that static names are simpler to manage, so\nyou might find them preferable to use over dynamic list names.\nSometimes, you may think that you need a dynamic list name when another approach is better.\nFor instance, the above list, authorsBooks:${authorId} may represent the list of books that\nwere written by the author with the ID authorId. In this situation, you could instead\nstore that list of IDs on the author object itself, like a foreign key\nin a relational database.\nThis might look like:\n// An author 'resource object'\n{\n  id: 'a39cva22',\n  name: 'Jane Austen',\n  books: ['103', '10', '129903']\n}\n\nIf the backend does not return this data with the author's primary data, then you may choose to store\nthe list of IDs on the author's resource metadata instead:\n// An author metadata object\n{\n  readStatus: 'SUCCEEDED',\n  updateStatus: 'IDLE',\n  createStatus: 'IDLE',\n  deleteStatus: 'IDLE',\n  books: ['103', '10', '129903']\n}\n\nAccessing the Resources in a List\nTo retrieve the resources in a list, you can use\ngetResources.\nimport { getResources } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './my-redux-store';\n\nconst state = store.getState();\nconst favoriteBooks = getResources(state.books, 'favorites');\n\nUpdating Lists\nIn the next guide, we will cover how you can\nmodify data within a resource slice, including lists.\n"},"docs/resources/modifying-resources.html":{"url":"docs/resources/modifying-resources.html","title":"Modifying Resources","keywords":"","body":"Modifying Resources\nThere are two ways to modify resources in the store: synchronously and asynchronously.

If a user can select or deselect resources in your interface, then you might\nuse UPDATE_RESOURCES to update the list representing their selection.\nCreating or Updating Resources\nThe UPDATE_RESOURCES action type is for updating resource information in the store. This action type\nallows you to update resources across multiple slices at the same time.\nYou can pass the following properties to this action:\n\nresources: An object of resource types to be updated. Here is an example action that updates\nthe books and authors slices at the same time:\n{\n  type: actionTypes.UPDATE_RESOURCES,\n  resources: {\n    books: {\n      24: {\n        title: 'The Hobbit\n      }\n    },\n    authors: {\n      1: {\n        name: 'J.R.R.

You will manually\nspecify your request keys, which isn't too hard to do if you follow a naming convention.\nHere are some example request keys you could use:\n\ncreateBook\nfetchBook\nfetchBooks\nupdateBook\ndeleteBook\n\nWe recommend using a verb somewhere in the request key or name. Some good CRUD-related verbs are:\n\ncreate\nget\nread\nfetch\nretrieve\nsearch\nfind\nfilter\nupdate\nchange\ndelete\nremove\n\nIf you're associating the request with a list, then you may\nwant to use the list name in the request key/name as well. For instance, if the list is\nfavorites, and the request is for a user searching through their favorites, then you may use\nsearchFavorites as the key.\nGenerated Request Keys\n\nNote: Official React bindings for Redux Resource are in the works, and it will generate\nrequest keys for you. This section describes how you might go about using generated\nrequest keys in your application today.\nKeep in mind that it is okay to use manually created keys. Generated keys aren't necessarily\nbetter.\n\nIf you're using a networking library that provides you with caching and/or request\ndeduplication features, then it may provide you with an identifying string that it generats\nfor each request. It may even call that string a key.\nFor instance, the libraries React Request and\nfetch-dedupe are both HTTP request libraries\nthat generate keys for you. If you're using those libraries with Redux Resource, then you can\nuse the key that they provide to you as the request key.\nThis example demonstrates using fetch-dedupe inside of a thunk action creator:\nimport { getRequestKey, fetchDedupe } from 'fetch-dedupe';\n\nexport function fetchBooks(bookId) {\n  const url = `/books/${bookId}`;\n  const fetchOptions = { credentials: 'include' };\n\n  const requestKey = getRequestKey({ url, method: 'GET' });\n  const dedupeOptions = { requestKey };\n\n  dispatch({\n    type: 'READ_RESOURCES_PENDING',\n    resourceType: 'books',\n    resources: [bookId]\n    requestKey,\n  });\n\n  return (dispatch) => {\n    fetchDedupe(url, fetchOptions, dedupeOptions)\n      .then(res => {\n        dispatch({\n          type: 'READ_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED',\n          resourceType: 'books',\n          resources: [res.data],\n          requestKey,\n        });\n\n        return res;\n      })\n      .catch(err => {\n        dispatch({\n          type: 'READ_RESOURCES_FAILED',\n          resourceType: 'books',\n          resources: [bookId],\n          requestKey,\n        });\n\n        return err;\n      });\n  }\n}\n\nA problem that needs to be solved when using generated request keys is retrieving the request data from\nthe store within your components. We encourage you to write a component that provides you\nwith a mapStateToProps that fetches the request information automatically for you. Official\nReact bindings for Redux Resource are being developed, and that is how it will work. It will use\nthe library React Request under-the-hood.\nWhen to Use Request Keys\nWe recommend using a request key for every request. In some situations, though, you\ncan use resource metadata in lieu of a request object. When resources are being modified,\nthey have built-in metadata (such as readStatus) that will be updated to reflect\nthe action that is modifying them. This alternative approach can be\nconsidered a convenience.\nIf you're manually creating request keys, then a rule of thumb to reduce the boilerplate\nthat you write is:\nUse a request key anytime that you do not have an ID, or a list of IDs, when you\ndispatch a \"pending\" action.\nFor example, if you attempt to fetch a book with ID of 23, then you will have\nan ID when you dispatch the \"read pending\" action (the ID is 23). So a\nrequest key may not be necessary in this situation, since you can look up the request\nstatus on book 23's metadata.\nOn the other hand, if you were to make a request to your backend for \"the list\nof books that were just released this past week,\" then you wouldn't have any IDs\nat the time that you dispatch the \"read pending\" action. So you need to use a\nrequest key in this situation to determine the request status.\nAn Example\nWhen a request key is used, the status of the associated request is stored in\nyour state, and you can access it with\ngetStatus:\nimport { getStatus } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nconst state = store.getState();\nconst searchStatus = getStatus(state, 'books.requests.search.status');\n// => Returns the following object:\n//\n// {\n//   idle: false,\n//   pending: true,\n//   failed: false,\n//   succeeded: false\n// }\n//\n\nWhen the request succeeds, you dispatch the following action:\nimport { actionTypes } fom 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED,\n  resourceType: 'books',\n  request: 'search',\n  // `newResources` are the list of books that were returned by the server\n  // for this query.\n  resources: newResources\n});\n\nNow when you call getStatus using this request key, you get the following object:\n{\n  idle: false,\n  pending: false,\n  failed: false,\n  succeeded: true\n}\n\n\"Reusing\" a Request Key\nRequest keys differ from IDs in that they don't need to be unique for every request. They can be,\nand will frequently be, reused between different requests of the same 'type.'\nFor instance, if a user can create books in your application, then you could just use the key createBook\nfor every creation request. This works really well if you can assume that a user is only able to send off\none of these create requests at a time, which is a restriction that many applications adhere to.\nWe don't encourage using the same request key across different 'types' of actions.\nFor instance, if a user can create favorite books, as well as delete favorite books,\nyou should use something like createFavorite and deleteFavorite for these two\nactions, rather than, say, using changeFavorites for both. This makes your code more\nexpressive, and also allows you to track both requests in the event that they are both\nare in flight at the same time.\nA Note on Dynamic Keys\nDevelopers who manually create request keys tend to make dynamic request keys. A dynamic request\nkey is any key that includes a variable, such as:\n`fetchBook:${bookId}`\nDynamic keys can be useful, but you can frequently get away with static keys.\nHere are some use cases for dynamic keys:\n\nImplementing response caching using request keys. If you plan to implement client-side\ncaching, then you could get a more granular cache by storing some extra information\nabout the request in the store. For more, check out\nthe recipe on caching.\n\nSupporting multiple of the same 'type' of request at once. If a user can delete\na book, and then, while that first request is loading, initiate a second request\nto delete another book, then you will want two loading indicators on your app.\nA static request key, such as deleteBook, won't be enough to capture this\ninformation. You might choose to use a dynamic request key in this situation.\n\n\nIf you aren't doing either of those things, then it may be worth considering if you could\nkeep things simple by just using a static key.\n"},"docs/requests/request-names.html":{"url":"docs/requests/request-names.html","title":"Names","keywords":"","body":"Request Names\nRequest names are a feature that can be useful if you are automatically\ngenerating request keys. If you are\nnot automatically generating request keys, then you probably do not need\nto use request names.\nMotivation\nAutomatically-generated request keys are useful for advanced networking features\nsuch as response caching and request deduplication, but they are often an inconvenience\nwhen it comes to debugging code.\nFor instance, if you have an endpoint that allows a user to run a user, two\nsearches against the endpoint may have the keys \"aBui9Xc\" and \"9d8cdd3\". These keys\ndon't communicate the purpose of these requests; they are just arbitrary strings.\nProviding a request name can help developers who are debugging the application.\nIn that situation, a request name like \"searchBooks\" could be specified. Later,\nwhen a developer is looking at the request, they will have some context on what\nthe intention of the request is.\nRequest names are like function names in JavaScript. Although we could use anonymous\nfunctions everywhere, we tend to provide names for our functions so that developers know what\nthey do.\nIn summary, request names are optional, human-readable descriptions of what the\nrequest's intention is.\nSpecifying a Request Name\nAdd the requestName property to a request action to specify a\nname for that request.\nimport { actionTypes } fom 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,\n  resourceType: 'books',\n\n  // In this situation, we are generating a key. It could be a random string of data,\n  // which makes debugging hard.\n  requestKey: generateRequestKey(/* request data */),\n\n  // By specifying a human-readable name, we are helping future developers out who are\n  // debugging our application.\n  requestName: 'searchBooks'\n});\n\nEvery request has two actions: a start action, and an end action. You should specify the\nname for both of these actions. For more on request actions, refer to the\nrequest actions guide.\n\nNote: if you specify the request property on an action, then it will be used\nas both the key and the name. This API is from Redux Resource requestKey and requestName separately going forward.\n\n"},"docs/requests/request-statuses.html":{"url":"docs/requests/request-statuses.html","title":"Statuses","keywords":"","body":"Request Statuses\nA request has a \"status\" associated with it, which represents the state that\nthe request is in. There are four statuses:\n\nIDLE: The request hasn't started yet\nPENDING: The request is in flight, and hasn't finished\nFAILED: The request finished, and failed\nSUCCEEDED: The request finished, and was successful\n\nA request has exactly one status at any given time. Here is an example request\nobject that is in a pending state:\n{\n  requestKey: 'createBook',\n  status: 'PENDING'\n}\n\nThe request status values are exported as\nrequestStatuses.\n\nNote: the request status is different from an HTTP status code. A request that\n  represents an HTTP request could also have a status code associated with it, such\n  as 200 or 404.\n\nWhy Use Request Statuses\nThe status of a request is useful for showing feedback to users of the application.\nWhen a request is in the pending state, you can display a loading indicator, and when it is\nfailed, you can show an error message.\nThe Status Lifecycle\nThe request status can be thought of as a cyclical lifecycle. Every request starts as IDLE.\nWhen the request begins, it moves to PENDING.\nWhen it resolves, it becomes SUCCEEDED or FAILED depending on the outcome.\nAnd lastly, there may be a time when you no longer need to display to the user that the\nrequest has succeeded or failed. At this time, you can make the request IDLE again.\nIf the application makes the same request again, the process will repeat itself.\nNot every request needs to go through the entire lifecycle. Sometimes, requests will\nsit indefinitely in the SUCCEEDED state after they resolve. Other times, you\nmay need to \"reset\" the state back to IDLE.\n\nNote: when a request is aborted, we recommend that you move it back to the IDLE\nstate. Webapps typically abort requests because the user no longer needs to know\nif the request succeeds or fails.\n\nProviding More Detailed Information\nThe request status provides a coarse representation of the status of the request,\nbut you will frequently need more granular information. Why did the request fail?\nWas the resource not found, or did the backend have an error? Is the user logged out,\nor did they lose their network connection?\nYou can store additional data on a request to capture information like this.\nFor instance, if your requests represent RESTful HTTP calls, then you could add the\nHTTP status code to the request. Or, if your requests represent gRPC calls, then\nyou could place the gRPC error code onto the request, too.\nThe request definition is intentionally flexible. It allows you store any additional\ninformation that you need. This enables Redux Resource's requests to work with any\nnetworking layer: RESTful HTTP endpoints, GraphQL, gRPC, web sockets, or whatever else\nyou may be using to transfer data.\n"},"docs/requests/request-actions.html":{"url":"docs/requests/request-actions.html","title":"Request Actions","keywords":"","body":"Request Actions\nAny time that you need to interact with resources over a network, you\nshould use request actions.\n\nNote: to make synchronous changes to a resource slice, you can use\nthe synchronous actions instead.\n\nRequests Require Two Actions\nRequests are asynchronous, so they take time to complete. First, a network request is sent off,\nand then sometime later it resolves.\nIn Redux Resource, this information is captured using two actions. Any time that\nyou make a request, you will need to dispatch both of these actions. The first\nis dispatched just before the request begins, and the second is dispatched\nonce the request completes.\nFor instance, the sequence of action types for a successful read request would be the\nfollowing:\nREAD_RESOURCES_PENDING ⇨ READ_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED\nThe PENDING action is always the \"start\" action. It is dispatched just before\nthe request begins. Then, once the request succeeds, or fails, or is cancelled, you\ndispatch the \"end\" action (SUCCEEDED in this case).\n\nNote: the redux-thunk middleware is\na great solution for supporting asynchronous action creators like the ones\nnecessary for dispatching request actions.\n\nAction Properties\nThese are the following properties that you may include on a request action:\n\ntype: The action type. The full list of request action types can be viewed\nhere.\nresourceType: The type the resource that is primarily being affected by this request\nresources: An array of affected resources\nrequestKey: The request key\nrequestName: The request name\nlist: The list to add the resources to\nrequestProperties: Additional data to store on the request\nmergeResources: A Boolean representing whether or not new resources are merged with\nexisting resources. Defaults to true.\nmergeMeta: A Boolean representing whether or not new resource metadata is merged with\nexisting resource metadata. Defaults to true.\nmergeListIds: A Boolean representing whether or not the new resources should replace\nan existing list or not. Defaults to true.\n\nThis section of this guide will cover these properties in more detail.\nAll request actions have a single required property, resourceType, which is the name\nof the resource that is being affected. The simplest action, then, looks\nsomething like this:\nimport { actionTypes } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,\n  resourceType: 'books'\n});\n\nThis action isn't very useful, however. Without more information about this\nrequest, Redux Resource doesn't know where to put this information in your\nstate tree, so this action doesn't change the store.\nTo reflect a request status in the state tree, you need to supply at least one\nof these two values in your action: a resources array, or a requestKey.\nresources\nA resources array represents the resources being affected by the action.\nIt can be an array of IDs, such as [1, 2, 3], or an array of resource objects,\nsuch as\n[\n  {\n    id: 1,\n    name: 'Brian',\n    phone: '444.444.4444'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 2,\n    name: 'Sarah',\n    phone: '222.222.2222'\n  }\n]\n\nYou can even mix the two. When it comes to a resources array, the important\npart is that the objects have some id. This associates the action with some\nresources.\nYou may be wondering when you might use the object form versus the shorthand\nform. There are two guidelines to remember, one for the start action, and one\nfor the end action.\nFor the start action, provide IDs, if you have them.\nFor the end action, provide the full resource definitions, if you have them.\nIf you don't, but you do have IDs, then provide those.\nLet's look at an example.\nIf you're reading a single resource, such as a book, then you might access that\nbook from your backend service with its ID. In this situation, you will have an\nID at the time that you dispatch the start action, so we include that ID in\nthe action's resources array:\nimport { actionTypes } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,\n  resourceType: 'books',\n  resources: [23]\n});\n\nWhen the request succeeds, you now have more detailed information about this\nbook to add to your store. So you would include the full book definition in the\nsuccess action's resources:\nimport { actionTypes } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED,\n  resourceType: 'books',\n  resources: [{\n    id: 23,\n    releaseYear: 2015,\n    author: 'Jane M. Goodfellow',\n    title: 'A History of Canada'\n  }]\n});\n\nWhenever a resources array is supplied, Redux Resource will update the\nmeta for each resource in that array.\nThe \"success\" action types also have special behavior with the resources\narray. For creates, reads, and updates, your state's resources object will be\nupdated to reflect any new data. For successful deletes, the state for that\nresource will be changed to be null, and the resource will be removed from the\nids array of all lists.\nIt isn't always possible to provide an array of resources in your action. For\ninstance, if the user is searching for books by entering a title, you couldn't\nknow which books will be returned until after the request has completed.\nTo keep track of the resources for requests like these, you need to use request\nobjects.\nrequestKey\nSupplying a requestKey will create a request object for\nthis operation within the requests section of the resource slice.\nFor instance, if your interface allows users to search for a books resource, you\nmight dispatch the following action:\nimport { actionTypes } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,\n  resourceType: 'books',\n  requestKey: 'booksSearch',\n});\n\nrequestName\nA human-readable string to help with debugging. For more, refer to the\nRequest Keys and Names guide.\nimport { actionTypes } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,\n  resourceType: 'books',\n  // In this example, we have some system to generate our request keys for us.\n  // This could be used by a system to implement request deduplication or\n  // response caching. An example library that generates request keys for you\n  // is fetch-dedupe:\n  // https://github.com/jamesplease/fetch-dedupe\n  requestKey: generateRequestKey(/* request options */),\n\n  // Because the request key is a randomly generated string, it can be convenient\n  // to know what the purpose of this request is.\n  requestName: 'searchBooks'\n});\n\nlist\nFor create and read operations, you can supply a list on a request action. This will\nadd the resources returned from the operation to the specified list on your slice.\n\nNote: you'll nearly always want to provide a request key when using lists. This is\nso that you can track the status of the request on the request object.\n\nimport { actionTypes } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,\n  resourceType: 'books',\n  list: 'mostPopular',\n  requestKey: 'getMostPopular',\n});\n\nTo learn more about lists, refer to the lists guide.\nOther Request Action properties\nThe following Request Action properties are all optional.\n\nmergeResources (Boolean): When an action results in resources being\nupdated in the store, this determines if the new data is merged with the old,\nor if it replaces the old data. Defaults to true. This only has an effect\non successful read, write, and update Actions.\n\nmergeMeta (Boolean): This is like mergeResources, but for metadata.\nDefaults to true. This property works with actions with any of the request\naction types.\n\nmergeListIds (Boolean): When a list is supplied, this lets you control\nwhether or not the new list of IDs replaces or gets merged into the existing\nlist of IDs for that list. When true, it will protect against duplicate\nIDs being added. Defaults to true. This only applies for successful read\nand write Actions that have a list specified.\n\nrequestProperties (Object): An object that will be merged onto the request\nobject. Use this to add additional data onto the request object, such as HTTP\nstatus codes, gRPC error codes, or any other information related to the request.\n\nrequest (String): A shorthand for setting\n\n\nDreprecated Request Action Properties\nThe following request action properties are deprecated, and will be removed in\nthe next major release of Redux Resource (4.0.0):\n\nrequest (String): A convenient way to set both the requestKey and the\nrequestName at the same time.\n\nresourceName (String): An alias of resourceType. Use resourceType instead.\n\n\nAction Creators\nThe core Redux Resource library does not include action creators, but there\nis a library, Redux Resource XHR, that includes\naction creators.\nYou're also free to build your own action creators. For examples, refer to these\nfour guides:\n\nReading Resources\nUpdating Resources\nCreating Resources\nDeleting Resources\n\nUsing the Action Types\nOne of this library's exports are these request action types. You can use them in\nyour application by importing them like so:\nimport { actionTypes } from 'redux-resource';\n\nFor a complete list of all of the action types, refer to the\nAction Types API Reference.\n"},"docs/requests/updating-lists.html":{"url":"docs/requests/updating-lists.html","title":"Updating Lists","keywords":"","body":"Updating Lists\nWhen a request succeeds, you will frequently want to add the resources returned\nby the response to a list. There is a convenient way\nto do this using the request actions.\n\nNote: if you're not familiar with resource lists, then you may want to\nread the documentation for them before continuing.  \n\nSpecifying a List\nTo specify the list to add the resources to, add the list property to a 'successful'\nrequest action.\nimport { actionTypes } fom 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED,\n  resourceType: 'books',\n  list: 'mostPopular',\n  requestKey: 'getMostPopular'\n  // `newResources` is the list of books that were returned by the server\n  // for this request.\n  resources: newResources\n});\n\nYou only need to specify a list for create or read success actions. Nothing happens\nif you specify a list for an update or delete action.\n\nNote: deleted resources will automatically be removed from any list that they are\nincluded in.\n\nWhy Specify a List\nThere are two main reasons to specify a list when making a request. The\ngetResources function lets you\nquickly access resources given a list name.\nFor instance, if you specify the list \"favoriteBooks\" when a request succeeds\nfor fetching a user's favorite books, then you can access the resources returned by\nthat request using the following snippet:\nimport { getResources } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './my-store';\n\nconst state = store.getState();\nconst favoriteBooks = getResources(state.books, 'favoriteBooks');\n\nConvenience aside, lists enable you to do sligtly complicated, but common task that is more\ndifficult to do otherwise. The situation it helps in is where the application fetches a collection of\nresources that the user can then modify.\nAn example may help demonstrate this. Consider a page that displays a user's favorite books. When the user\nnavigates to the page, a request to fetch the favorite books is made.\nAfter the request completes, the user is able to add or delete favorite books. After they\nadd or delete a book, you want the favorite books that are displayed to them to reflect their\nchanges.\nThere are two ways to do this:\n\nafter the create or delete request succeeds, you make a second request to fetch\nthe list of favorite books a second time, so that the list is up-to-date\nafter the create or delete request succeeds, you update the local list of favorite books\nwithout making a second request\n\nBoth of these approaches are great. You can do whichever you think is best.\nIf you decide to go with the second method, then using a list makes this straightforward to do. It\nworks like this: when the request to fetch the favorite books succeeds, you can add the resources to the\nfavoriteBooks list. Then, when the user creates or deletes a new favorite book, you modify the\nlist.\nReplacing List IDs\nBy default, subsequent requests with the same list will merge the old list IDs with the\nnew IDs. You can replace the old list with the new by passing mergeListIds: false in your\naction. For instance:\nimport { actionTypes } fom 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED,\n  resourceType: 'books',\n  list: 'mostPopular',\n  mergeListIds: false,\n  // `newResources` is the list of books that were returned by the server\n  // for this request.\n  resources: newResources\n});\n\nMore Reading\nFor more on lists, refer to the lists guide and\nthe Lists FAQ.\n"},"docs/requests/reading-resources.html":{"url":"docs/requests/reading-resources.html","title":"Reading Resources","keywords":"","body":"Reading Resources\nRedux Resource provides four action types for\nreading resources asynchronously. They are:\n\"READ_RESOURCES_PENDING\"\n\"READ_RESOURCES_FAILED\"\n\"READ_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED\"\n\"READ_RESOURCES_IDLE\"\n\nEach request will always begin with an action with type\nREAD_RESOURCES_PENDING. Then, one of the other three action types will be\nused to represent the resolution of that request. Use the other action types in the\nfollowing way:\n\nREAD_RESOURCES_FAILED: Use this if the request fails for any reason. This\ncould be network errors, or any\nHTTP Status Code\ngreater than or equal to 400.\nREAD_RESOURCES_IDLE: Use this when the request is aborted.\nREAD_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED: Use this when the request was successful.\n\nRequest Objects\nSpecifying a request key on the actions will create a\nrequest object in the store for this request. This object can be used to look up\nthe status of the request.\nAlthough it is recommended that you specify a request key when possible, there are some\nsituations when you may not need to when fetching resources.\nWhen fetching a single resource, you typically provide the ID to be fetched. Therefore,\nrequest objects aren't always necessary, as you can\ntrack the request on the resource's metadata directly.\nFor read requests that return multiple resources, it is typically preferable to specify\na request key.\nSuccessful Reads\nWhen an action of type READ_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED is dispatched, three things\nwill happen:\n\nthe resources included in the action's resources will be added to the\nresources section of the resource slice. Existing resources with the same ID\nwill be merged with the new ones. To replace existing resources, rather than\nmerge them, specify mergeResources: false on the action.\n\nThe metadata for each of the resources specified on the action will be updated\nwith  readStatus: 'SUCCEEDED'. To replace all of the existing meta, rather than\nmerging it, specify mergeMeta: false on the action.\n\nWhen a list is passed, the IDs from the resources array on the action will\nadded to the list. You may specify mergeListIds: false to replace the existing\nlist instead.\n\n\nRedux Resource XHR\nRedux Resource XHR \nprovides an action creator that simplifies making CRUD requests. If you'd like to\nbuild your own, then that's fine, too. The example below may help.\nExample Action Creator: Reading One Resource\nThis example shows an action creator to read a single book.

We recommend using the react-redux\nlibrary to link Redux with React.\nThe following are some patterns that we find ourselves using frequently with Redux Resource.\nUsing mapStateToProps\nWe recommend placing your calls to getResources\nand getStatus within\nmapStateToProps. That way, you can access this information from any of the\ncomponent's lifecycle methods, without needing to compute them within each method.\nFor example:\nimport { getResources, getStatus } from 'redux-resource';\n\nfunction mapStateToProps(state) {\n  const searchedBooks = getResources(state.books, 'searchResults');\n  const searchStatus = getStatus(state, 'books.requests.getSearchResults.status');\n\n  return {\n    searchedBooks,\n    searchStatus\n  };\n}\n\nType Checking with Prop Types\nRedux Resource Prop Types exports a number of helpful prop types for common props\nthat you'll pass into your React Components. Read the Redux Resource Prop Types\ndocumentation for more.\nUsing Request Statuses\nThis is such an important topic that there is a\ndedicated guide for it.\nDetermining When a Request Succeeds\nSometimes, you want to know the exact moment that a request succeeds. You can do this\nwithin your components by comparing the previous state with the next state to determine\nwhen a request changes from one status to another.\nWe recommend performing this check within componentWillReceiveProps. This\nmight look like:\nimport { getResources, getStatus } from 'redux-resource';\n\nclass BooksList extends Component {\n  render() {\n    // Render contents here\n  }\n\n  // Let's log to the console whenever a search result succeeds\n  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {\n    if (this.props.searchStatus.pending && nextProps.searchStatus.succeeded) {\n      console.log('The search request just succeeded.');\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nfunction mapStateToProps(state) {\n  const searchStatus = getStatus(state, 'books.requests.getSearchResults.status');\n\n  return {\n    searchStatus\n  };\n}\n\nThis same approach can also be used to detect the moment that a request fails.\n"},"docs/other-guides/tracking-request-statuses.html":{"url":"docs/other-guides/tracking-request-statuses.html","title":"Tracking Request Statuses","keywords":"","body":"Tracking Request Statuses\nDisplaying feedback about CRUD operations requires knowing the\nstatus of its request: is it pending,\nfailing, succeeded? This is what we mean by \"tracking\" a request. The status of\na request can be used to display feedback to the user of your application, such\nas showing loading indicators or error messages.\nThere are two ways to track CRUD operation requests in Redux Resource:\nusing a request object, or tracking the status\non resource metadata.\nTypically, you should use request objects, but in some situations you may prefer to use\nresource metadata instead.\nRequest objects\nYou can use request objects to track any request that your application makes. Request\nobjects are by far the more powerful of the two options for tracking requests,\nso we recommend using them whenever possible.\nTo learn about the shape of request objects, refer to\nthe request objects guide.\nTo dispatch actions that create request objects, you need to supply a requestKey to\nwith your request actions. For instance,\n{\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,\n  resourceType: 'books',\n  requestKey: 'searchBooks'\n}\n\nThis will update your resource slice to look like the following:\n{\n  resourceType: 'books',\n  requests: {\n    searchBooks: {\n      requestKey: 'searchBooks',\n      status: 'PENDING'\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nFor more on request actions, refer to the request actions guide.\nResource Metadata\nIn a limited number of situations, you may not need to specify a requestKey\nwith your request actions.\nThis is true whenever your CRUD operations directly target a resource, or a\nset of resources, by their ID. For instance, if the user is fetching a book\nwith ID 23, then this action is directly targeting the book with ID of 23.\nLikewise, deleting books with IDs 100, 101, and 102 is a request that is\ntargeting these three resources directly.\nAny time that you have a set of IDs when the request is sent off, then you can\ntrack the status of the operation on the resource metadata directly. You can\ndo this by passing a resources array with the start action.\nLet's look at an example. The action that represents beginning a read request\nof a book with ID 24 looks like the following:\n{\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,\n  resourceType: 'books',\n  resources: [24]\n}\n\nWhen this is dispatched, your slice's metadata will be updated like this:\n{\n  meta: {\n    24: {\n      createStatus: 'IDLE',\n      readStatus: 'PENDING',\n      updateStatus: 'IDLE',\n      deleteStatus: 'IDLE'\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nIn your view layer, you can then use\ngetStatus to access this state in a\nconvenient way.\nThe rule of thumb is:\nYou can track CRUD operation requests on resource metadata anytime you have an\nID when you fire the \"start\" action type.\nAlthough using request objects is optional, we encourage their use beuause they provide\nconsistency across your code base. Request objects allow you to track the status of every\nrequest, whereas resource metadata only works in a subset of situations.\nUsing Statuses\nYou now know how to store the request statuses in your store. There is a\nseparate guide on using\nUsing Request Statuses in your\nview layer.\n"},"docs/other-guides/using-request-statuses.html":{"url":"docs/other-guides/using-request-statuses.html","title":"Using Request Statuses","keywords":"","body":"Using Request Statuses\nWhen request action types are dispatched, Redux Resource\nwill store information about those requests\nin the store. This guide will cover how you can use those statuses in your\nview layer.\n\nNote: these examples are React components using react-redux. Keep in mind\nthat nothing in Redux Resource requires React: if you're using Redux with any other\nview layer, then this library will work just as well.\n\ngetStatus\nOne of the exports of this library is\ngetStatus. This function facilitates\nusing Redux Resource request statuses to build your interfaces. It will likely\nbe one of the Redux Resource functions that you rely on the most.\nLet's look at an example. Let's say we have a page that displays details about\na book. We might write the following component:\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux';\nimport { getStatus } from 'redux-resource';\n\nexport class BookDetails extends Component {\n  render() {\n    const { book, readStatus } = this.props;\n\n    return (\n      \n        {readStatus.pending && 'Loading...'}\n        {readStatus.failed && 'There was an error.'}\n        {readStatus.succeeded && (\n          \n            \n              {book.title} ({book.id})\n            \n            \n              {book.releaseYear}, {book.author}\n            \n          \n        )}\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nfunction mapStateToProps(state, props) {\n  // A user can pass a `bookId` into this Component to view the book's data\n  const bookId = props.bookId;\n  const readStatus = getStatus(state, `books.meta[${bookId}].readStatus`, true);\n  const book = state.books.resources[book.id];\n\n  return {\n    book,\n    readStatus\n  };\n}\n\nexport default connect(mapStateToProps)(BookDetails);\n\nYou can see how the object returned from getStatus makes a render function\nvery expressive. It's also convenient that there aren't any checks for\nexistence here, even though our data is nested in our store: the API of\nRedux Resource provides you with very predictable data.\nAggregating Statuses\nOften times, the data displayed on a single page comes from multiple sources.\nWhenever possible, we recommend using multiple getStatus calls in these\nsituations, so that you can display information to the user as it becomes\navailable. This way, if one endpoint is slow, or if the request fails entirely,\nthe rest of the interface isn't affected by it.\nWith that said, we know this isn't always possible. Sometimes, you simply\ndo need to wait for multiple requests to resolve before there is anything\nuseful to show on the page.\nYou can use getStatus to aggregate these calls together into status. The\nAPI for this is as follows:\nimport { getStatus } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './get-store';\n\nconst state = store.getState();\n\nconst aggregatedStatus = getStatus(state, [\n  'books.meta.23.readStatus',\n  'books.requests.getBookComments.status'\n], true);\n\nThe rules of aggregation work as follows:\n\nIf any status is failed: true, then the group is failed: true.\nIf no status is failed: true, but at least one is pending: true, then the\ngroup is pending: true.\nIf all statuses are succeeded: true, then the group is\nsucceeded: true.\n\nAt most, only one of these values will ever be true.\nIf treatIdleAsPending (the third argument, see below) is false, then all three\nvalues will be false if all of the request statuses in the state tree are\n\"IDLE\".\ntreatIdleAsPending\nThe third argument to getStatus is a Boolean called treatIdleAsPending. It\ndetermines whether a request status of \"IDLE\" will count as pending or not.\nConsider an interface that loads a particular book when the page loads. Right\nat page load, there will always be a short moment when the request hasn't begun,\nyet your store has been set up. At this moment, the request status for this read\nwill have a value of \"IDLE\".\nIf you don't pass true, then there will be a \"flash of no content\" unless\nyou explicitly check for the \"IDLE\" status yourself. To avoid this, pass\ntreatIdleAsPending as true, and getStatus will instead consider that to be a\npending state.\nThe default value of treatIdleAsPending is false.\nThe Rule of Thumb\nThere is a rule of thumb for using treatIdleAsPending:\n\nFor requests that happen when the page loads, pass treatIdleAsPending as true\nFor requests that happen as a response to a user's action (such as clicking a\nbutton), pass treatIdleAsPending as false\n\n"},"docs/other-guides/custom-action-types.html":{"url":"docs/other-guides/custom-action-types.html","title":"Custom Action Types","keywords":"","body":"Custom Action Types\nYou can add support for additional action types to a\nresourceReducer\nusing plugins.\nThe name 'plugins' may seem intimidating, but don't be worried.

The second\nargument to that function is an options options, and within it you can pass\nplugins as an array:\nimport resourceReducer from 'redux-resource';\nimport somePlugin from './some-plugin';\nimport anotherPlugin from './another-plugin';\n\nexport default resourceReducer('books', {\n  plugins: [somePlugin, anotherPlugin]\n});\n\nWriting a Plugin\nA plugin is a function that with the following signature:\n(resourceType, options) => reducerFunction\n\nWhere resourceType and options are the arguments that you passed to\nresourceReducer.\nThe return value, reducerFunction, is also a function. This returned function\nhas the same signature as a Redux reducer:\n(previousState, action) => newState\n\nwhere state is the value of the state after running it through the built-in\nreducer and action is the action that was dispatched.\nThe simplest plugin then (which doesn't do anything), would look like this:\nfunction myPlugin(resourceType, options) {\n  return function(state, action) {\n    return state;\n  }\n}\n\nIf you prefer using arrow functions, you might choose to write this like so:\nconst myPlugin = (resourceType, option) => (state, action) => state;\n\nThis plugin isn't very exciting, so let's look at more realistic examples.\nSelecting Resources\nLet's build a plugin that lets a user select resources. The code\nfor this plugin looks like this:\nimport { setResourceMeta } from 'redux-resource';\nimport myActionTypes from './my-action-types';\n\nexport default function(resourceType, options) {\n  return function(state, action) {\n    // Ignore actions that were dispatched for another resource type\n    if (action.resourceType !== resourceType) {\n      return state;\n    }\n\n    if (action.type === myActionTypes.SELECT_RESOURCES) {\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        meta: setResourceMeta({\n          resources: action.resources,\n          meta: state.meta,\n          newMeta: {\n            selected: true\n          },\n          initialResourceMeta: options.initialResourceMeta\n        })\n      };\n    } else if (action.type === myActionTypes.UNSELECT_RESOURCES) {\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        meta: setResourceMeta({\n          resources: action.resources,\n          meta: state.meta,\n          newMeta: {\n            selected: false\n          },\n          initialResourceMeta: options.initialResourceMeta\n        })\n      };\n    } else {\n      return state;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nYou would then use this plugin like so:\nimport { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux';\nimport { resourceReducer } from 'redux-resource';\nimport selectResources from './plugins/select-resources';\n\nlet store = createStore(\n  combineReducers({\n    books: resourceReducer('books', {\n      plugins: [selectResources]\n    }),\n  })\n);\n\nCustomizable Plugins\nYou can write plugins that can be customized per-slice by taking advantage of\nthe fact that the resourceReducer's options are passed into plugins. For\ninstance, if you had a plugin like the following:\nexport default function customizablePlugin(resourceType, options) {\n  return function(state, action) {\n    if (options.useSpecialBehavior) {\n      // Perform a computation\n    } else {\n      // Do some other computation here\n    }\n  };\n}\n\nthen you could trigger the special behavior by passing\nuseSpecialBehavior: true as an option to resourceReducer:\nimport resourceReducer from 'redux-resource';\nimport customizablePlugin from './customizable-plugin';\n\nexport default resourceReducer('books', {\n  plugins: [customizablePlugin],\n  useSpecialBehavior: true\n});\n\nIf this API isn't to your liking, then you can also just wrap the plugin itself\nin a function, like so:\nexport default function(pluginOptions) {\n  return function customizablePlugin(resourceType, options) {\n    return function(state, action) {\n      if (pluginOptions.useSpecialBehavior) {\n        // Perform a computation\n      } else {\n        // Do some other computation here\n      }\n    };\n  };\n}\n\nwhich would be used in the following way:\nimport resourceReducer from 'redux-resource';\nimport customizablePlugin from './customizable-plugin';\n\nexport default resourceReducer('books', {\n  plugins: [\n    customizablePlugin({ useSpecialBehavior: true})\n  ]\n});\n\nYou may dislike this approach due to the tripley-nested functions. That's fine,\nbecause either way works. Use the version that makes the most sense to you.\nBest Practices\nBecause plugins are so similar to reducers, you can use a switch statement\nand support multiple action types within each plugin. This is usually a\ngood thing, but be mindful of keeping each plugin limited to a single\nresponsibility.\nFor example, in the above example of a plugin for selecting resources, it\nsupports two Action types – one for selection, and one for deselection. This\nplugin encapsulates that one responsibility, and it isn't responsible for any\nother Action types.\nWe recommend having a plugin for each distinct responsibility.\n"},"docs/other-guides/migration-guides.html":{"url":"docs/other-guides/migration-guides.html","title":"Migration Guides","keywords":"","body":"Migration Guides\nOn occasion, we release breaking changes to the libraries.

However you decide to\nmanage your form data, it should work well alongside Redux Resource.\nUsing Resource Slices\nYou can also store form information inside of the resource slice. A  Redux best practice is to\nseparate your client-side data separate from your server-side data, so form information should\nbe kept separate from the actual resource objects themselves.\nInstead, you might choose to use meta for form information, or\nperhaps an additional \"top-level\" key within the resource slice, such as forms.\nOne thing to consider before going with this approach is whether or not your form allows a user\nto modify more than one resource at a time. If it does, then you may want to consider storing\nthe form data outside of an individual resource slice.\n"},"docs/recipes/canceling-requests.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/canceling-requests.html","title":"Canceling Requests","keywords":"","body":"Canceling Requests\nMany applications transfer data using HTTP requests. One feature of HTTP\nrequests is that they can be cancelled.\nAs a rule of thumb, for each request that you make in your application, there\nwill always be one situation where you will want to cancel that request to\nprevent bugs.\nWhy do it\nCanceling requests prevents race conditions. A race condition occurs when you\nhave two requests in flight at the same time, but your code is written such that\none must resolve before the other. As you may know, requests can resolve\nin any order, which leads to the bugs.\nA common pattern we've seen in Redux applications is this:\n\nwhenever a request completes, an action is dispatched\na reducer responds to that action, updating the state\na view renders using the latest data from the state\n\nThis pattern isn't bad – it's great! You just need to be aware that\nit can lead to bugs when requests aren't cancelled.\nLet's look at two examples that demonstrate the problem.\nExample: A Typehead\nConsider a \"typeahead\" component that allows a user to type to search for books.\nEven when the user's input is debounced, there are situations where two (or more)\nactive requests can be in flight. The user can type, wait a moment for a request\nto send, then type one key to fire off a second request. If the backend response\ntime is slower than the debounce time, then two search requests will be in\nflight at once.\nBecause the requests can complete in any order, it is possible that the user's\nearliest search results will return after their latest search results. If\nyour code is written such that the last-received search results are displayed,\nthen that can lead to the wrong search results being shown.\nCanceling a previous request resolves this problem, as it means that only one\nsearch request will ever be in flight at a time, and it will be the user's most\nrecent search. If you're using an action creator that returns a native\nXMLHttpRequest object, such as the action creator from\nRedux Resource XHR, then your code may look\nlike this:\nclass Typeahead extends Component {\n  searchBooks: function(query) {\n    if (this.searchBooksRequest) {\n      this.searchBooksRequest.abort();\n    }\n\n    this.searchBooksRequest = this.props.searchBooks(query);\n  }\n}\n\nAnother tip is to cancel any requests when the component unmounts. If the search\nresults aren't needed when the component unmounts, then letting a request complete\nwill still update your state tree, which can cause unnecessary renders in your\napplication. Canceling requests in componentWillUnmount might look something\nlike:\nclass Typeahead extends Component {\n  componentWillUnmount: function() {\n    if (this.searchBooksRequest) {\n      this.searchBooksRequest.abort();\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nExample: Pagination\nConsider a page of an application that displays books. Often, long lists of\nresources will be paginated, and a user can move between the pages by clicking a\n\"next\" or \"previous\" button.\nA race condition can occur when the user clicks the buttons too fast, or when\nthe backend service is slow. If your view layer renders out the results of the\nlatest response, then it's possible that they could see the results from the\nwrong page.\nSimilar to the search example above, ensuring that only a single page of data\nis being fetched at once is the solution.\nThe solution is the same as the typeahead example:\n\ncancel any existing page-change requests before starting a new one\nconsider if it makes sense to cancel the request when the component\nunmounts\n\nA common feature of these bugs is that they depend on unreliable network\nconditions, so they don't usually come up in a development environment. This\nmakes them easy to ignore, but they're still worth protecting against.\nHow to do it\nTypically, applications do not need to inform the user when a request is aborted.\nAccordingly, Redux Resource does not track if a request is in an aborted state. Instead,\nwe encourage you to set the request status back to \"IDLE\" when the request is canceled.\nFor a read request, this may look something like:\nimport { actionTypes } from 'redux-resource';\n\n// You will need to determine that the request was aborted;\n// different libraries have different systems for doing this\nlet requestWasAborted;\n\nif (requestWasAborted) {\n  dispatch({\n    type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_IDLE,\n    ...otherActionAttributes\n  })\n}\n\n\nNote: If your application requires tracking the aborted status of a request, you\n  can write a plugin to add support for additional action types.\nNote: We understand that some users want their action type names to reflect the action\n  that is being performed, rather than the result of the action. We agree that this is a good\n  practice to follow. If you do, too, it may irritate you that there is no READ_RESOURCES_ABORT\n  action type. This is omitted in an effort to keep the surface area of Redux Resource small,\n  since that action would behave the same as READ_RESOURCES_IDLE.\n\nCanceling requests in popular libraries\nThere are many different tools developers use to make requests. In this section,\nwe will go through how to cancel requests using some of the most common tools.\nXMLHttpRequest\nIn browsers, the native way to cancel a request is to call the abort method\non an XMLHttpRequest.\nconst myRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();\nmyRequest.open('GET', 'books');\n\nmyRequest.abort();\n\nxhr\nThe xhr library simplifies the creation of\nXHR objects. Because it returns a native XMLHttpRequest object, canceling\nrequests with xhr is the same as when you use the native XMLHttpRequest\nconstructor.\nimport xhr from 'xhr';\n\nconst request = xhr.get('/books/23', (err, res) => {\n  if (req.aborted) {\n    console.log('Request cancelled');\n  }\n});\n\nrequest.abort();\n\nRedux Resource XHR for \nRedux Resource uses xhr for requests.\nThe action creator exported by this library returns a native XHR object, so you\ncan use the abort method to cancel those requests.\nfetch\nThe native fetch\nmethod is a tool for making requests that returns a\nPromise.\nNative Promises cannot be cancelled (yet),\nso we cannot recommend using fetch.\naxios\naxios is a Promise-based approach to HTTP\nrequests that supports cancellation. It uses a system of canceling Promises\ncalled \"Cancel Tokens,\" which is based off of\na withdrawn cancelable Promises proposal.\nTo see how to cancel axios requests, refer to\nthe axios documentation.\nBluebird\nBluebird is Promise implementation that supports\ncancellation using an onCancel method.\nRefer to the Bluebird documentation\nfor specifics on the onCancel method.\nObservables in RxJS\nRxJS is a Reactive Programming library for async code using Observables. It includes Observable.ajax() for HTTP requests and supports cancellation by calling subscription.unsubscribe(), or using something like .takeUntil().\nIf you happen to be using redux-observable, refer to that library's documentation\nfor\na recipe for request cancellation.\nAlternatives\nYou don't always need to cancel requests. Two other options are:\n\nPrevent the user from performing an action more than once. For instance, in\nthe search example, you could prevent the user from typing if a search of theirs\nis already in flight. And in the pagination example, you can disable the\n\"next\" and \"previous\" buttons until the new page loads. In these examples,\nthis approach is clearly a subpar experience, but sometimes it does make\nsense. For instance, disabling a \"Delete\" button for a book once the user\nclicks it once, or disabling a \"Buy\" button after the user confirms a\npurchase.\n\nYou could write code to keep track of which request's response is the correct\none to display. We generally find it to be simpler to cancel requests instead.\n\n\nThere may be other options, too, and different approaches may make more sense to\nyou based on the situation.\n"},"docs/recipes/unauthorized-responses.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/unauthorized-responses.html","title":"Unauthorized Responses","keywords":"","body":"Unauthorized Responses\nSome applications log users out after a certain period of time. For single page\napps, this usually presents itself as requests to the backend suddenly failing\nfor the logged-out user. This can occur when the user leaves the application\nopen in their browser over night, for instance.\nA common UX pattern is to display a notification to the user when this occurs,\nso that they can log back in. This recipe describes one way that you can detect\nwhen a user is logged out, so that you can notify them however you see fit.\nYour server\nThe backend that you interface with needs to provide a consistent representation\nof the user being logged out.\nIf your API uses proper\nHTTP status codes,\nthen this means that the responses will have a 401 status code.\nThe rest of this guide will assume that the backend returns a 401 HTTP status\ncode, although this same system works for other representations, too.\nAction Creators\nWhenever an unauthorized response from the backend is returned in your CRUD\naction creators, include the status code in the request action\nthat you dispatch.\nYou can attach arbitrary data to a request by specifying requestProperties on\nthe action.\nIf you're using Redux Resource XHR,\nthen this will be set for you. You can access the status code at\naction.requestProperties.statusCode.\nIf you're not using Redux Resource XHR, then your code may look\nsomething like:\nexport function readBook(id) {\n  return function(dispatch) {\n    dispatch({\n      type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,\n      resourceType: 'books',\n      resources: [id]\n    });\n\n    // `request` would be whatever function you are using to make HTTP\n    // requests. It could be `window.fetch()`, axios, superagent, xhr,\n    // or anything else that you prefer.\n    request('/some-url', (err, res) => {\n      // Different libraries attach the status code to different properties.\n      // It is usually either `res.status` or `res.statusCode`. You do not\n      // need to check both properties if you know which one your library uses.\n      if (err || res.statusCode >= 400 || res.status >= 400) {\n        dispatch({\n          type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_FAILED,\n          resourceType: 'books',\n          resources: [id],\n          requestProperties: {\n            statusCode: res.statusCode\n          }\n        });\n\n        return;\n      }\n\n      // Check to see if the request was cancelled, or if it succeeded, then\n      // dispatch the appropriate action here.\n    });\n  }\n}\n\nReducer\nThe final step is to write a reducer that updates the state tree whenever\nthese failed actions occur. Here is an example reducer that does this:\nimport { actionTypes } from 'redux-resource';\n\nconst {\n  READ_RESOURCES_FAILED,\n  UPDATE_RESOURCES_FAILED,\n  CREATE_RESOURCES_FAILED,\n  DELETE_RESOURCES_FAILED\n} = actionTypes;\n\nexport default function reducer(state = false, action) {\n  const isFailedAction = action.type === READ_RESOURCES_FAILED ||\n    action.type === UPDATE_RESOURCES_FAILED ||\n    action.type === CREATE_RESOURCES_FAILED ||\n    action.type === DELETE_RESOURCES_FAILED;\n\n  if (isFailedAction && action.requestProperties.statusCode === 401) {\n    return true;\n  }\n\n  return state;\n}\n\nBefore an unauthorized response has been received, this reducer will return\na state of false.  When a logged-out response is received, then the reducer\nwill update the state to be true.\nYou'll want to use this reducer with\ncombineReducers:\nimport { combineReducers } from 'redux';\nimport unauthorizedReducer from './unauthorized-reducer';\n\nconst reducer = combineReducers({\n  unauthorized: unauthorizedReducer,\n  // ...other store slices (your resource reducers, etc.)\n});\n\nWith this in place, you have a slice of your state tree that will be true\nwhenever an unauthorized response is received.\nYou can use this value in your view layer to toggle the appearance of a modal,\nor some other notification, to let the user know that they need to log back in.\n"},"docs/recipes/user-feedback.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/user-feedback.html","title":"User Feedback","keywords":"","body":"User Feedback\nIt's important to provide a user with feedback of the status of network\nrequests. When applications don't provide good request feedback, users will\nlose confidence in the app. You may have experienced this first hand if you've\never clicked a button within an application, and then thought to yourself,\n\"Did that work?\"\nYou don't want to create those negative experiences, and when you use Redux Resource,\nyou have all of the information you need to create good ones instead.\nIn this recipe, we will cover some tips for providing good feedback to your\nuser around requests. Think of these tips as guidelines, rather than rules set in\nstone. Different applications require different user experiences.\nPending Requests\nYou should visually communicate to the user anytime that a request is in flight. This\nlets them know that the application is processing the operation.\nThe getState method returns an object with\na pending property, which will be true whenever the associated request is in\nflight. You can use this to show a spinner, for instance. If you're using React,\nthis might look like:\nrender() {\n  const { state } = this.props;\n  const readStatus = getStatus(state, 'books.meta[24].readStatus');\n\n  return (\n    \n      {readStatus.pending && ()}\n    \n  );\n}\n\nA spinner is a common pattern for indicating that an operation is underway, but\nit doesn't work in every situation. For instance, you might know that the\nrequest will take awhile, such as large file uploads. In those situations, it\nmight make sense to use a different element, such a a progress bar, to represent\nthe progress of the request.\nRegardless of how you communicate the loading state, loading indicators should\nbe unobtrusive. Some applications will overlay the whole interface, or a large\nsection of the interface, with a spinner\nwhenever an action occurs. This prevents the user from taking any other\naction with the page while also hindering their ability to read content on the\npage. This is a bad user experience.\nIn many situations, a better approach is to display a loading indicator near to\nthe affected elements on the page. For instance, if the user is deleting a\nresource from a list of resources, then perhaps it makes sense for a spinner to\nbe displayed next to the delete button that they clicked. This prevents\nthe spinner from interfering with other, unrelated elements on the page.\nDisabling Interface Elements\nSometimes, it makes sense to disable elements of an interface when a CRUD\nrequest is in flight. Always take a minimalist approach when it comes\nto disabling interface elements: disable as little as possible.\nTypically, if a user clicks a button to initiate a request, then you will\nwant to disable that button so that they don't submit multiple requests at\nthe same time.\nSome example buttons that you should consider disabling are:\n\na delete button. It doesn't make sense for two delete requests to be in\nflight at the same time.\n\na payment button\n\na \"save\" button to save their changes to a resource\n\n\nSometimes, developers go too far when they disable interface elements. For\ninstance, some applications cover the entire page, or a large portion of the\npage, with a loading indicator. This prevents the user from interacting\nwith a large portion of the page, which is a poor user experience.\nIf you're using React, an example code snippet of disabling a button is:\nrender() {\n  const { state } = this.props;\n  const deleteStatus = getStatus(state, 'books.meta[24].deleteStatus');\n\n  return (\n    \n      \n        Delete Book\n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\nFailed Requests\nWhen a request fails, there should be a human-readable message that states that\nthe request was unsuccessful. Unless your users are developers, error codes\nprobably won't be helpful to users. A message that simply says \"There was an\nerror with your request.\" can provide a better user experience than one that\nsays \"Error code 2603,\" even though it technically contains less information.\nI don't mean to convey that error codes aren't useful. They can be! Especially\nin logs and diagnostics. But always ask yourself if it makes sense to display\nthem to the user.\nIf you're able to convert an error code into a more specific, human-readable\nmessage (like \"You must provide an email address.\"), then that's even better.\nIn addition to an explanatory message, it sometimes makes sense to provide the\nuser with a link to attempt the operation again as part of the message. In\nReact, a typical error message might look like the following:\nrender() {\n  const { state } = this.props;\n  const readStatus = getStatus(state, 'books.meta[24].readStatus');\n\n  return (\n    \n      {readStatus.failed && (\n        \n          \n            There was an error fetching the book.\n          \n          \n            Retry.\n          \n          \n      )}\n    \n  );\n}\n\nAn even better UI would distinguish between different error types. Why was\nthere an error? Did the network request fail because the user lost their\ninternet connection? Did they get logged out? Did some form data fail\nserver-side validation?\nYou can store information about the error on the response object to provide\nan even better user experience.\nUnauthorized Responses\nSome applications expire a user's session after a period of time. When that\noccurs, the user won't be able to perform any CRUD operations until they log\nback in.\nThere is a recipe that provides you\nwith a Boolean that is true whenever this happens. Once you have that value,\nyou can let the user know that they've been logged out.\nOne way to do this would be to open a modal letting them know what happened,\nand what they need to do. You can even make the modal have one button,\n\"Log in again.\" If you choose to use this method, be considerate of the fact\nthat a user may have been inputting data into a form. If you interrupt their\nworkflow like this, it's wise to save their work into local storage, and let\nthem know that when they log in, the information that they've entered won't be\nlost.\nIf you're using React, the code to do this may look like the following:\nrender() {\n  const { unauthorized } = this.props;\n\n  return (\n    \n      {unauthorized && ()}\n    \n  );\n}\n\nSuccessful Requests\nUsers typically know when a read request succeeds because the data\nthat was fetched is displayed in the interface. For other requests, such as\nupdating a resource or deleting a resource, you should consider providing\nsome other indicator.\nSome examples of indicators include:\n\nA toast or notification that appears, stating that the operation succeeded.\n\nText appearing on the interface, stating that the request succeeded. This approach\nis frequently seen on account and settings pages when changes are made.\n\nIf a spinner is used for the loading state, it could be transformed into\na green checkmark, indicating success.\n\n\nThis list is not meant to be exhaustive; there are many other ways to indicate success.\nSuccess indicators follow a similar pattern to the other indicators if you're\nusing React. For instance:\nrender() {\n  const { state } = this.props;\n  const updateState = getStatus(state, 'books.meta[24].updateStatus');\n\n  return (\n    \n      {updateState.succeeded && ('Your settings have been updated')}\n    \n  );\n}\n\n"},"docs/recipes/related-resources.html":{"url":"docs/recipes/related-resources.html","title":"Related Resources","keywords":"","body":"Related Resources\nEndpoints frequently more than one resource type in a single response.

Official React bindings for Redux Resource are in the works, and\nthey will be built using React Request, a powerful,\ndeclarative HTTP library for React.\nThis recipe contains tips that could help you if you're interested in writing your own\ncaching implementation, either by using React Request or by writing your own system.\nCaching using requests\nHow can you know if a response has already been returned for a given request? The way\nthat we recommend doing it is by using request objects.\nHere's how it works with React Request:\nReact Request implements its own\ncaching system.\nIts caching is powered by a string called a\n\"request key\" based\non the request configuration you pass to it. Two requests with the same key are considered identical.\nThis automatically-generated \"request key\" will be used as the Redux Resource request name, which is\nwhat ties the two libraries together.\n\nNote: a future update to Redux Resource will support having a separate \"request key\" and \"request name.\"\nThe key will be useful for features such as response caching and request deduplication, while the\nname will be used for debugging.\nAs it stands, the \"name\" in Redux Resource is fulfilling both roles.\n\nAccessing data from a dynamic key\nTools like getStatus are more difficult to use directly when using a dynamic request name.\nIn the official React bindings for Redux Resource, the solution to this problem will be a wrapping\ncomponent around React Request will automatically pull the details of that request from the Redux\nstore, and pass it to you in a render prop function. It will also pull the resources, resource meta,\nand lists that the request affected.\nBecause of this, you will rely a lot less on directly using\ngetStatus and getResources when using React Redux Resource, although they will still be\nthere should you need them.\nThe role of lists\nSometimes, requests contribute to a list. For instance, if you fetch a user's favorite books,\nand then they create a new favorite book, you may have a list called \"favoriteBooks\", which\nis what your component renders out.\nWhat do you do in this situation? Simply continue to cache at the request level.\nBy using a cached response, you are making the claim that a response from the server for that\nrequest could not provide any more information for the list that you already have.\nAs a result, you do not make the request, and you continue to render out the locally-cached list.\n"},"docs/extras/":{"url":"docs/extras/","title":"Ecosystem Extras","keywords":"","body":"Ecosystem Extras\nThe Redux Resource ecosystem provides bits of code that make working with the library even better.\n\nRedux Resource Action Creators\nRedux Resource XHR\nRedux Resource Plugins\nRedux Resource Prop Types\n\n"},"docs/extras/redux-resource-action-creators.html":{"url":"docs/extras/redux-resource-action-creators.html","title":"Redux Resource Action Creators","keywords":"","body":"Redux Resource Action Creators\n\n\nThis library makes it more convenient to create valid Redux Resource actions. It helps out in two ways:\n\nRemembering the Redux Resource action types can be difficult\nOften times, your \"start\" and \"end\" actions share many properties, and it can be verbose to copy + paste\nthose properties\n\nUnlike Redux Resource XHR, these action creators do not make the requests\nfor you. All this library does is create the actions themselves.\nInstallation\nInstall redux-resource-action-creators from npm:\nnpm install redux-resource-action-creators --save\nThen, import createActionCreators in your application:\nimport createActionCreators from 'redux-resource-action-creators';\n\nUsage\nThis library has a single export, createActionCreators.\ncreateActionCreators( crudAction, actionDefaults )\nArguments\n\ncrudAction: (String) The CRUD operation being performed. One of \"create\",\n\"read\", \"update\", or \"delete\". This determines the\nCRUD Action types that are dispatched.\n\nactionDefaults (Object): Properties that will be included on each dispatched\n action. The the Request Action guide lists possible\n options, such as resourceType and resources. You must include resourceType.\n\n\nReturns\n(Object): An object with four methods: pending, succeeded, failed, and idle.\n  These action creators return actions for you, based on the action properties that\n  you provide to them.\nExample\nimport createActionCreators from 'redux-resource-action-creators';\nimport store from './store';\n\nconst readActionCreators = createActionCreators('read', {\n  resourceType: 'books',\n  requestKey: 'getHomePageBooks',\n  list: 'homePageBooks',\n  mergeListIds: false\n});\n\nstore.dispatch(readActionCreators.pending());\n\nconst req = fetchData((err, res, body) => {\n  if (req.aborted) {\n    store.dispatch(readActionCreators.idle());\n  } else if (err) {\n    store.dispatch(readActionCreators.failed());\n  } else {\n    store.dispatch(readActionCreators.succeeded({\n      resources: body\n    }));\n  }\n});\n\nTo understand why you might use this library, compare that example versus this common Redux\nResource code:\nimport { actionTypes } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,\n  resourceType: 'books',\n  requestKey: 'getHomePageBooks',\n  list: 'homePageBooks'\n});\n\nconst req = fetchData((err, res, body) => {\n  if (req.aborted) {\n    store.dispatch({\n      type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_NULL,\n      resourceType: 'books',\n      requestKey: 'getHomePageBooks',\n      list: 'homePageBooks'\n    });\n  } else if (err) {\n    store.dispatch({\n      type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_FAILED,\n      resourceType: 'books',\n      requestKey: 'getHomePageBooks',\n      list: 'homePageBooks'\n    });\n  } else {\n    store.dispatch(readActionCreators.succeeded({\n      type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED,\n      resourceType: 'books',\n      requestKey: 'getHomePageBooks',\n      list: 'homePageBooks',\n      resources: body\n    }));\n  }\n});\n\nAll that this library does is provides a simple pattern to write less, more expressive code. If you'd like, you could get many\nof the same benefits by defining shared action properties, and then spreading them in your actions:\nimport { actionTypes } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nconst actionDefaults = {\n  resourceType: 'books',\n  requestKey: 'getHomePageBooks',\n  list: 'homePageBooks'\n};\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  ...actionDefaults,\n  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,\n});\n\nconst req = fetchData((err, res, body) => {\n  if (req.aborted) {\n    store.dispatch({\n      ...actionDefaults,\n      type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_NULL,\n    });\n  } else if (err) {\n    store.dispatch({\n      ...actionDefaults,\n      type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_FAILED,\n    });\n  } else {\n    store.dispatch(readActionCreators.succeeded({\n      ...actionDefaults,\n      type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED,\n      resources: body\n    }));\n  }\n});\n\n"},"docs/extras/redux-resource-xhr.html":{"url":"docs/extras/redux-resource-xhr.html","title":"Redux Resource XHR","keywords":"","body":"Redux Resource XHR\n\n\n\nLooking for the 2.x API?\nClick here.\nBetter yet, looking to migrate to 3.x?

All of the Request Action options are\nsupported, such as resourceType and resources.\n\ndispatch: (Function) The dispatch function of a Redux store. If you're using\nredux-thunk), this will be the first\nargument of the thunk.\n\nxhrOptions: (Object) Options to pass to the xhr library.\nYou must pass a a url (or uri) option. You will typically also want to pass\njson: true, which will serialize your request body into JSON, as well as\nparse the response body as JSON. For more, see the examples below and\nthe xhr documentation.\n\n[transformData]: (Function) An optional function to transform the data\nreceived by the server. It receives one argument, body, which is the\nresponse from the server, parsed as JSON. Return a transformed list of\nresources. This can be used to format the server response into a\nRedux Resource-compatible format. For more, see the guide on\nResource objects.\n\n[onPending]: (Function) An optional function that allows you to modify\nthe \"pending\" action, as well as control when it is dispatched. It is called\nwith one argument: action. When this function is provided, you will be\nresponsible for dispatching the action.\n\n[onAborted]: (Function) An optional function that allows you to modify\nthe \"aborted\" action, as well as control when it is dispatched. It is called\nwith arguments (action, res). When this function is provided, you will be\nresponsible for dispatching the action.\n\n[onFailed]: (Function) An optional function that allows you to modify\nthe \"failed\" action, as well as control when it is dispatched. It is called\nwith arguments (action, err, res). When this function is provided, you will be\nresponsible for dispatching the action.\n\n[onSucceeded]: (Function) An optional function that allows you to modify\nthe \"succeeded\" action, as well as control when it is dispatched. It is called\nwith arguments (action, res, body). When this function is provided, you will be\nresponsible for dispatching the action.\nIf all that you need to do is transform the resources that your backend returns,\nthen you should use transformData instead of onSuceeded.\n\n\n\n\nReturns\n(XMLHttpRequest): An instance of a\nXMLHttpRequest.\nTypically, you'll use this object to abort the request (should you need to) by\ncalling myXhr.abort().\nExample\nimport { crudRequest } from 'redux-resource-xhr';\nimport store from './store';\n\nconst xhrOptions = {\n  method: 'GET',\n  json: true,\n  url: '/books',\n  qs: {\n    user: 'someone@example.com'\n  }\n};\n\nconst xhr = crudRequest('read', {\n  dispatch: store.dispatch,\n  actionDefaults: {\n    resourceType: 'books',\n    requestKey: 'getHomePageBooks',\n    list: 'homePageBooks',\n    mergeListIds: false\n  },\n  xhrOptions\n});\n\n// Cancel the request if you need to\nxhr.abort();\n\nxhr( options )\nThis is the library used to make HTTP requests. It is a thin wrapper around the\nlibrary xhr, and supports all of the same\noptions and signatures.\nOn top of that, it adds several new features:\n\nSupport for query string serialization (similar to the request library).\n\nOmitting the callback will return a native\nPromise.\n\n\nCustomizing Query String Serialization\nIf you pass a qs object, then the object will be serialized into a query parameter\nusing the querystringify library. This\nlibrary supports basic serialization, but we don't expect it to work for every API that\nyou interface with.\nYou can change how the query string is serialized using two options:\n\nqsStringify - a function with the signature (qs, options). It should return\nthe string to be appended to the URI.\n\nqsStringifyOptions - an object that is passed as the second argument to the qsStringify\nmethod.\n\n\nFor instance, if you wish to use the qs library, you might do this:\nimport { xhr } from 'redux-resource-xhr';\nimport qs from 'qs';\n\nxhr('/books', {\n  method: 'GET',\n  qs: {\n    pageSize: 10,\n    pageNumber: 0,\n    publishers: ['goldenBooks', 'penguinBooks']\n  },\n  qsStringify: qs.stringify,\n  qsStringifyOptions: { arrayFormat: 'brackets' }\n}, cb);\n\nExample\nimport { xhr } from 'redux-resource-xhr';\n\nconst booksSearch = xhr.get('/books', {\n  // Pass a `qs` option, and it will be stringified and appended to the URL\n  // for you\n  qs: {\n    bookName: 'brilliance of the moon'\n  },\n  json: true\n}, (err, res, body) => {\n  console.log('Got some books', body);\n});\n\n// Later, you can abort the request:\nbooksSearch.abort();\n\n// Omit a callback to get a native Promise. This can be useful sometimes, but the\n// tradeoff is that you cannot cancel Promises.\nxhr.get('/books/24')\n  .then(\n    (res) => console.log('got a book', res),\n    (err) => console.log('there was an error', err)\n  );\n\nTips\n\nThe onSucceeded option of crudRequest can be useful if your backend returns\nrelated resources in a single request.\n\nThe onSucceeded and onFailed options can also be used for chaining requests.\nYou can make a second (or third, or fourth!) HTTP request in these callbacks. This\nis useful when you need to make multiple requests to get all of the data that your\ninterface needs.\n\nA good pattern for using this collection is to make your own action creators\nthat \"wrap\" these action creators using\nredux-thunk. That way, your view layer\ndoesn't need to concern itself with all of the configuration necessary to use\nthese action creators. For instances, an action creator for reading books in\nyour application may look like the following:\nimport { crudRequest } from 'redux-resource-xhr';\n\nfunction readManyBooks({ pageNumber }) {\n  return (dispatch) => {\n    const xhrOptions = {\n      method: 'GET',\n      json: true,\n      url: '/books',\n      qs: { pageNumber }\n    };\n\n    return crudRequest('read', {\n      actionDefaults: {\n        resourceType: 'books',\n        requestKey: 'getHomePageBooks',\n        list: 'homePageBooks',\n        mergeListIds: false,\n      },\n      xhrOptions,\n      dispatch\n    });\n  };\n}\n\nThen, in your view layer, you can call readManyBooks({ pageNumber: 5 }).\n\n\n"},"docs/extras/redux-resource-prop-types.html":{"url":"docs/extras/redux-resource-prop-types.html","title":"Redux Resource Prop Types","keywords":"","body":"Redux Resource Prop Types\n\n\nA collection of prop-types objects.\n\nTrying to migrate from v2 of this library?

What this means is that any new\nrequests will immediately update any existing status code to be 0.\nIf you're using the status code to display UI elements, you may need to cache\nthe last completed request's status in your component's state to get the\nbehavior that you're looking for.\n\n\n"},"docs/extras/selection-plugin.html":{"url":"docs/extras/selection-plugin.html","title":"Selection","keywords":"","body":"Selection Plugin\nDeprecated\nThis plugin is deprecated.

There are\nsimilar projects that also aim to\nreduce Redux boilerplate, which are also worth your consideration.\nDoes this only work with React?\nNo. The only requirement is that you are using Redux, or a library that has a\nsimilar API to Redux.\nHow does this library handle immutable state?\nThis library uses shallow cloning for state tree updates. This has worked well\nfor us, even on medium-to-large sized applications.\nRedux Resource does not work well with libraries like\nImmutable.js, although we're open\nto adding support for Immutable if it doesn't bloat the library too much. If\nthis is something you're interested in,\nopen an issue and we\ncan talk more about it.\nDoes this only work with APIs that return data in a specific format?\nNo, this library is agnostic to the format that you receive data in. The only\nrequirement is that each resource that you pass into this library has an id\nattribute.\nWe understand that not every system stores its resources with an id attribute.\nFor instance, if you're working with a books resource, then it might instead\nhave an id attribute called bookId. In these situations, you will need to\nwrite a transform that maps that key to be id instead.\nFor more, refer to the Resource objects guide.\nDoes this work with a backend that adheres to a well-defined format, such as JSON API?\nYes, it does. You may want to write a plugin to handle\nsome advanced features provided by specifications such as JSON API, such as rich\nrelationship support.\nDoes this work with backends that are not strictly \"RESTful\"?\nYes. The only requirement is that the data returned can be reasonably mapped to\nthe concept of a \"resource.\" A resource, from this library's perspective, is\na JavaScript object with an id attribute.\nFor more on this, refer to the Resource objects guide.\nDoes Redux Resource handle forms, or client-side changes to data?\nThis library complements, but does not replace, solutions for managing forms\nand other ways to manipulate resource data on the client. Redux Resource\nworks will with any system for managing forms, such as view state,\nreact-redux-form,\nor redux-form.\nWhy does getStatus take the entire state as the first argument, while getResources takes a slice?\ngetResources always returns one subset of resources of a single type, so it wouldn't make sense to pass\nthe entire state as the first argument. When aggregating request statuses, you may need to aggregate across\nmultiple slices, so it's a requirement that getStatus support that.\nIn older versions of Redux Resource, getResources accepted state as the first argument. The problem\nwith this approach is that it really only worked well when you were using combineReducers. Although we\nbelieve that most people are likely using combineReducers, we didn't want that to be a hard requirement\nfor using Redux Resource.\n"},"docs/faq/state-tree.html":{"url":"docs/faq/state-tree.html","title":"State Tree","keywords":"","body":"State tree\nCan I store additional metadata for resources within meta?\nYou can, and we encourage it. We recommend that you avoid changing the values of\nthe request statuses directly (use the built-in Action types to do this), but\nfeel free to store anything else in there that you want.\nYou can use the UPDATE_RESOURCES action type to change the metadata of\nresources.\nIf you'd like to update metadata alongside a request, then you can write a\nplugin for that.\nA future version of Redux Resource will support this without a plugin.\nCan I store additional properties on each state slice?\nYes, you can. The only requirement is that you don't change the structure of the\nstate that you start out with: make sure that resources, meta, lists, and\nrequests remain Objects. If you stick with that you shouldn't run into any issues.\nAs a convention, we recommend only storing data relevant to the resource in the\nslice. Use another slice for other information.\nCan I store more than one resource per state slice?\nWe don't recommend doing this.\n"},"docs/faq/actions.html":{"url":"docs/faq/actions.html","title":"Actions","keywords":"","body":"Actions\nAre there Action Creators?\nNot in the core library.\nWhen it comes to making requests, there is an\nHTTP Action Creators library.\nDevelopers have different preferences when it comes to making requests, so\nwe made this library easy to use with any library that you choose. We've\nhad great success with the library linked to above, but should you choose to\nwrite your own, we have guides to help you.\nRefer to the Request Actions guide to learn more\nabout how to build your own action creator, or the four CRUD guides for examples\nof action creators:\n\nReading resources\nUpdating resources\nCreating resources\nDeleting resources\n\nDoes Redux Resource require you to use a specific tool for making HTTP requests?\nNo, you can use any system for making requests that you'd like. We do strongly encourage\nyou to use a library that supports cancellation.\nShould all Actions include a request key?\nIf you're manually coming up with the the request keys, then it is typically extra boilerplate\nto always use them. In those situations, we recommend only using request keys\nwhen they provide you value.\nBecause request keys are used to make request objects within the store, anytime that you need a\nrequest object is when you should use a request key. The two most common use cases for request\nobjects are:\n\ncreating resources\n\nmultiple bulk reads of the same resource type on the same page\n\n\nIf you're not doing either of those things, then you might not need to name the request,\nand that's fine.\nA handy rule of thumb for when to use request objects, as well as much more\ninformation about requests, can be found in\nRequest Keys and Names guide.\nWhen is setting the mergeMeta action attribute to false useful?\nAt the moment, we don't know of any use case for doing this. We included this attribute\nin the event that you find one – we're sure there's one out there!\n"},"docs/faq/lists.html":{"url":"docs/faq/lists.html","title":"Lists","keywords":"","body":"Lists\nHow can you keep a list in order?\nRedux Resource currently only provides lists as a way to keep track\nof the initial sort order returned from a single request. As more\nrequests are made against a single list, it will not respect any\nparticular order.\nIf you'd like to maintain ordering of some kind within a specific\nlist, or all of your lists, then we recommend\nwriting a plugin to handle that.\nCan lists be used for keeping track of client-side lists of resources?\nYes, they can. Use the UPDATE_RESOURCES action type to manage\nclient-side things.\nHow do you know when to use dynamically-named lists or not?\nIn the majority of situations, you won't need to use dynamic lists.\nFor instance, if you are building a banking application that lets a user\ndisplay transactions for each of their bank accounts, you might think\nto make a list for each one, like this:\ntransactionsFor${accountId}\nThere are situations when this could be useful. For instance, if you wish\nto display the transactions of many bank accounts onscreen at once. Most\napplications, though, only let the user see one set of transactions per\naccount at once. Therefore, it's much better to just use a single list.\ntransactionsForAccount\nAs the user moves between pages in the application, you can set mergeListIds\nto false to throw away the previous list, and start fresh.\nConcerned about caching? That should be handled at the request level instead. Check\nout the caching recipe for more.\nIf you need animations, then you may consider using dynamic lists or a solution\nlike freezus to \"freeze\" the state\nof the outgoing component.\nWhy is mergeListIds set to true in request actions by default?\nThere are a few reasons.\n\nIt's nice that all of the mergeX attributes of the CRUD actions are true by default.\nMultiple requests can contribute to a list. For instance, a user may read a list of\nfavorites, and then create a new favorite. In this situation, we have multiple requests\ncontributing to the same list, so it's good that the resources are merged, rather than\nreplaced.\n\nWe understand that mergeListIds is one of those attributes that you'll frequently be\nsetting to false. We believe the reasons above justify keeping it true by default, but\nif you disagree, feel free to\nopen an issue\nand we'd be happy to discuss it further with you!\n"},"docs/api-reference/":{"url":"docs/api-reference/","title":"API Reference","keywords":"","body":"API Reference\nTop-Level Exports\n\nresourceReducer\ngetStatus\ngetResources\nupsertResources\nsetResourceMeta\nactionTypes\nrequestStatuses\n\nImporting\nEvery function or object described above is a top-level export.

If you pass an array of status locations, then they\nwill be aggregated. For more on status locations and status aggregation, see\nthe Notes below.\n\n[treatIdleAsPending] (Boolean): Whether or not a request status of IDLE is\nto be considered as a pending request. Defaults to false. See Tips on\nwhen to use this.\n\n\nReturns\n(Object): An Object representing the status of this request for the\n  statusLocation. It has the following shape:\n  {\n    idle: Boolean,\n    pending: Boolean,\n    failed: Boolean,\n    succeeded: Boolean\n  }\n\n  Only one of these values is always true, reflecting the value of the request\n  status. When treatIdleAsPending is true, then request statuses that are\n  \"IDLE\" will be returned as pending: true.\nNotes\n\nPassing an array of status locations as the second argument will aggregate the statuses. The\naggregation works as follows:\n\nIf all of the requests are idle, then the aggregate status is idle\nIf any of the requests are failed, then the aggregate status is failed.\nIf no requests have failed, but some are pending, then the aggregate status is pending.\nIf all requests have succeeded, then the aggregate status is succeeded.\n\n\nA status location is a string that specifies a location of a request status in\nyour state tree. For instance \"books.meta.24.readStatus\" or\n\"books.requests.dashboardSearch.status\".\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that treatIdleAsPending also works when aggregating.\n\nExamples\nIn this example, we pass a single status location:\nimport { getStatus } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nconst state = store.getState();\nconst bookDeleteStatus = getStatus(state, 'books.meta[23].deleteStatus');\n\nIn this example, we pass two locations:\nimport { getStatus } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nconst state = store.getState();\nconst bookReadStatus = getStatus(\n  state,\n  [\n    'articles.meta[23].readStatus',\n    'comments.requests.detailsRead.status'\n  ],\n  true\n);\n\nTips\n\nThe third argument, treatIdleAsPending, is useful for requests that are made when\nyour components mount. The components will often render before the request\nbegins, so the status of these requests will be IDLE. Passing treatIdleAsPending\nwill consider these IDLE states as pending: true.\n\nIf you're using React, we recommend computing your getStatus values in\nmapStateToProps, and then passing them in as props into your component. That\nway, you have access to this information in all of the lifecycle methods of\nyour component.\n\nThe first argument, state, doesn't always need to be the state of your\nRedux store. For instance, if you're using this method within your component's\nlifecycle methods, such as componentWillReceiveProps, you may instead pass\nit an object that is a subset of the state.

The\ncomplete object is shown below:\n{\n  IDLE: 'IDLE',\n  PENDING: 'PENDING',\n  FAILED: 'FAILED',\n  SUCCEEDED: 'SUCCEEDED',\n}\n\nExample\nimport { requestStatuses } from 'redux-resource';\nimport store from './store';\n\nconst state = store.getState();\n\nif (state.books.meta['23'].readStatus === requestStatuses.PENDING) {\n  console.log('A book with id \"23\" is currently being fetched.');\n}\n\nTips\n\nAlthough this object can be used to check the status of a request in your\nview layer, it's often more convenient to use getStatus\nfor that purpose. For this reason, we recommend restricting your usage of this\nobject to plugins, reducers, or action creators.\n\n"}}}
